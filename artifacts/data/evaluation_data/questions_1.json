    "question": "Why is there a push to replace the traditional C2F4H2-based gas mixture in RPC detectors with ecological alternatives?",
    "ground truth": "The ecological gas (HFO-1234ze) has a lower Global Warming Potential (GWP) than traditional C2F4H2-based mixtures, making it a better alternative. Adding CO2 shifts the operating voltage to a C3H2F4-based mixture, which aligns with environmental goals. The ecological gas maintains performance comparable to traditional mixtures without compromising efficiency.",

    "ground truth": "The main advantage of YieldNet over traditional models is its ability to combine corn and soybean yield predictions, outperforming individual models. Additionally, its use of transfer learning between crops and XGBoost's efficiency in feature extraction further enhances accuracy. Lastly, the model's robustness and alignment with expert knowledge in yield prediction contribute to its effectiveness.",

    "ground truth": "No, the introduction clearly states that while digital twins are often seen as general-purpose data collectors, the focus here is on creating specific goal-oriented indicators. These indicators provide cleaner, more relevant data to inform decision-making and address key issues in food systems effectively.",

    "ground truth": "Methane has a much higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period and a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of approximately 9 years. This means that reducing methane emissions can lead to rapid decreases in atmospheric warming, making it a powerful tool for meeting short-term climate goals like those set in the Paris Agreement.",
