    "question": "Why is there a push to replace the traditional C2F4H2-based gas mixture in RPC detectors with ecological alternatives?",
    "ground truth": "Traditional C2F4H2-based gas mixtures used in Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) have a very high Global Warming Potential (GWP), prompting a push to find ecological alternatives. Although closed loop systems reduce gas emissions, they are expensive and prone to leaks. Hence, ecological gases like HFO-1234ze (C3F4H2) with significantly lower GWP are being explored to achieve sustainability without compromising detector performance.",

    "question": "What is the main advantage of YieldNet over traditional single-crop yield prediction models using remote sensing data?",
    "ground truth": "YieldNet introduces a novel convolutional neural network framework that enables the simultaneous prediction of multiple crop yields (corn and soybean) using transfer learning. Unlike traditional models that require separate models for each crop, YieldNet shares the backbone feature extractor between crops and incorporates a new loss function for multi-target regression. This approach improves prediction accuracy and reduces computational costs by eliminating the need for training multiple models.",

    "question": "Is the primary aim of using a digital twin in food systems to collect as much general-purpose data as possible, regardless of relevance?",
    "ground truth": "No, the introduction clearly states that while digital twins are often seen as general-purpose data collectors, the focus here is on creating specific goal-oriented indicators. These indicators provide cleaner, more relevant data to inform decision-making and address key issues in food systems effectively.",

    "ground truth": "No, while traditional ground surveys are limited in scale, the paper highlights that modern imaging techniques, including aerial RGB and LiDAR data, along with deep learning methods like DeepLabv3+ and U-Net, enable large-scale detection of both exposed and buried stonewalls through vegetation patterns and terrain features.",

    "question": "Why is reducing methane emissions considered an effective short-term strategy for mitigating climate change?",
    "ground truth": "Methane has a much higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period and a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of approximately 9 years. This means that reducing methane emissions can lead to rapid decreases in atmospheric warming, making it a powerful tool for meeting short-term climate goals like those set in the Paris Agreement.",
